   - Monthly or yearly subscriptions for premium features.
   - Average Subscription Fees: $10/month or $100/year.

3. **In-App Advertising**:
   - Displaying targeted ads to users, including banner ads, video ads, and sponsored content.
   - Revenue Estimate: With a projected 10,000 active users, ad revenue could reach $50,000 annually.

4. **In-App Purchases**:
